Many stream ecologists/biogeochemists use the salt slug method to estimate discharge in streams.  
I adapted some code to calculate discharge in a stream using a slug injection of salt, so it is easy to input few parameters. It is written as a Shiny app in Rstudio, you can find the code to use it yourself [here](https://github.com/rocher-ros/dischargeApp_shiny/wiki).
